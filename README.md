# MedTime

## Project Description and Motivation:
This repository contains the apk file for an app created by me and a few friends at the UF hackathon Swamphacks. This app is basically a medicine timer that requires a video confirmation of the person taking the medicine to be sent to a nurse or doctor. This was created with MIT app inventor.

## Design Goals:
- creating useful application
- implementing patient and nurse accounts with passwords
- sending data back and forth between accounts
- using video and timer features

## Repository Information/Installation and Testing: 
You will need the MIT app inventor app on android or your computer to test this. The source files cannot be read through github.
